<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Below are some questions I&#8217;ve been asked over the years relating to my work. For those questions that are generic and not specific to Ithkuil, I&#8217;ve taken the liberty (i.e., the lazy person&#8217;s approach) of linking elsewhere to someone who&#8217;s already answered the question better than I could.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style13">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify" class="style10"><span class="style14"> How  fluent are you in Ithkuil? Can you speak/read/understand it?</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">  The  only portion of Ithkuil in which I am “fluent” is the morphology. I have never tried to memorize the lexicon. I am fairly proficient  in knowing the characters of the script but still need to look up the rules  when writing it.</p>

<p align="justify" class="style10"><span class="style14"> Are  you a professional linguist? How many languages do you speak or understand?</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">  I  have a bachelor’s (undergraduate)   degree in linguistics. Poverty and circumstances prevented me from attending graduate school. Nevertheless, I have continued to study linguistics as a personal  hobby my entire adult life. I am not a linguist professionally. Besides my  native language English, I speak French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese sufficiently  well to converse with natives as long as the conversation doesn’t get too technical or specialized. I speak enough fractured German to get myself in trouble. I  also read Catalan and the auxiliary language Interlingua fairly  well, although I do not speak them.</p>

<p align="justify" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10"><span class="style14"> Is Ithkuil an attempt to create a working version of Robert Heinlein’s Speedtalk language? Is conciseness the primary purpose of Ithkuil?</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Many persons have compared Ithkuil to the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.urticator.net/essay/2/296.html" target="_blank">Speedtalk</a>&rdquo;  language in Robert Heinlein&rsquo;s novella <em>Gulf</em>, in which  every morpheme (meaningful word-part) is apparently represented by a single  phoneme (sound).  However,  Heinlein&rsquo;s Speedtalk appears to focus only on the morpho-phonological component  of language (i.e., the correspondence between sound and individual grammatical  components) without any corresponding focus on the logical redesign of a  language&rsquo;s <a href="00_intro.html#terminology" target="_blank">morphology, lexico-morphology, or lexico-semantics</a> to provide an  equally &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; morpho-syntactical and lexical component. Ithkuil has been  designed with an equal focus on these latter linguistic components.  Additionally, the apparent purpose of Heinlein’s language is simple  rapidity/brevity of speech and thought, while Ithkuil is focused on maximal  communication of cognitive intent in the most efficient manner, a somewhat  different purpose, in which brevity <em>per se</em> is irrelevant.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Most descriptions of Ithkuil that I’ve read misrepresent the  purpose of the language to be this sort of morpho-phonological conciseness, i.e., the &ldquo;Speedtalk&rdquo; factor. In fact, Ithkuil’s primary purpose  is to demonstrate how human language could be used to convey much deeper levels of human cognition and semantic nuance/exactitude than are found in natural human languages. As for morpho-phonological conciseness, it is merely a secondary goal to ensure that the greater amount of morpho-semantic information conveyed by the language (as compared to natural languages) does not cause phrases and sentences to become long-winded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style13">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style13">  How  did the idea of Ithkuil come to you? Have you worked on the language on a 
  regular  basis?  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10"> At  university, I studied linguistics, and it was there that I gained the knowledge  and tools for understanding how languages are structured. However, the more  languages I read about and studied, the more I came to realize how  inefficiently most languages function in terms of conveying thought in both a  precise and a concise manner. I also noticed that certain languages were  subjectively “better” than others in the manner that they were able to  convey a specific task. For example, I noticed how elegant and efficient the  three-letter root structure of Semitic languages like Arabic and Hebrew were as  a means of building words compared to European languages. I noticed how the  perfective versus imperfective verbal aspect of Slavonic languages like Russian  were able to convey certain verbal distinctions easily which languages like  English had to use whole phrases to convey. In other cases, I found certain  languages that grammaticalized thoughts that most other languages did not (such  as the “4th  person” distinction of  certain American Indian languages). I also fell in love with all the exotic and  difficult-topronounce consonant sounds of Caucasian languages like Abkhaz and  Ubykh, as well as the numerous vowels of Uralic and Altaic languages. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Anyway, the idea  came to me that I might try to create a language which “combined” the  most efficient and interesting features of all the languages I was familiar  with. And so the seed of the language which eventually evolved into Ithkuil was  born. The more I worked on it over the years, the more of my own ideas went  into it, as opposed to simply borrowing ideas from existing languages. Then,  during the 1980s, I discovered the  new cognitive school  of linguistics that was beginning to arise in the United States (specifically the writings of George Lakoff and Ronald Langacker). These writings  opened up a whole new level of understanding regarding the relationship between  human thought and language which led to a major overhaul and expansion of the language  I was working on in my spare time. It was at this point that I got the idea  that I would try to accomplish the seemingly incompatible goals of creating a  language capable of conveying much more information than natural human  languages do, while simultaneously being more brief and concise than natural  human languages (previously, all versions of the language were very long-winded). </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">The work was  slow, painstaking, and often frustrating. Between the mid-1980s and the  mid-1990s, I abandoned the work at least a dozen times out of frustration  (aggravated by the fact that every time I thought I was getting nearly  finished, I would decide to scrap about 75% of what I had and start over with  better ideas). Sometimes several months would go by before I would pick up  where I left off. The breakthrough came around 1996 when my interest was  re-ignited by discovery of the writings of two other cognitive linguists, Gilles  Fauconnier and  Len Talmy. Their research and findings on the structure of human thought and  language renewed my interest in wanting to finish the project. By 1999, the  grammar was about 95% finished and it was time to start finalizing the script  and the lexicon. Incidentally, it was at this point that I discovered  Robert Heinlein’s description of “Speedtalk” from  his novella “Gulf.” At first I was surprised and mildly disappointed that  someone had already thought of doing what I was working on, but then I realized  that Speedtalk was only a shallow attempt which worked at the  morpho-phonological level of language only, while the language I was creating  took the same principles and applied them to all the different structural  levels of language. It took me another four years to reach the point where I  felt the work was complete enough to show the world, then it took me another  year to write it all up formally on the computer (the language was developed  entirely using pencil and paper) and create a website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style13">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style13"> Some people have claimed that using Ithkuil, a person would be able to think five times faster. Do you believe this?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">This oft-repeated claim apparently started with Stanislav Kozlovskiy in his 2004 article “The Speed of Thought” published in the Russian-language science magazine <em>Kompyuterra</em>. The question presupposes that thought is linguistic in nature, which is certainly debatable. Personally, I believe only complex conceptual thought   is  linguistic, not simple conceptual thought and certainly not thought at the perceptual level (i.e., I certainly don’t mentally say to myself “I’m in pain” when I stub my toe). At any rate, even if we grant that thought is linguistic, any supposed “speeding up” of thought using the concise morpho-phonology of Ithkuil would most likely be offset by the sheer volume of morphological information which Ithkuil requires one to express (and therefore mentally consider when formulating a sentence). For example, merely saying (or thinking) that it’s raining outside would require a hypothetical Ithkuil speaker to consider the evidential source of the information (direct observation? hearsay? inference?) and its reliability (Validation), the pattern and timing of the raindrops (Phase), the purpose/intent of the utterance (Sanction), whether the rainfall is being considered as a gestalt versus a sequence of discrete componential events (Configuration), whether the context of the thought/utterance is  descriptive, purposefully important, metaphorical, or a component of a holistic situation (Context), and so on. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">For these reasons, I believe use of Ithkuil would probably allow one to think more deeply, critically, and analytically; but think faster? I doubt it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style13">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style13">Assuming Ithkuil were to be used in the real world, wouldn’t its complexity cause it to break down within one or two generations into a vulgar form which operates like natural languages, undermining the whole point of ithkuil’s construction?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">As  for a hypothetical community of Ithkuil-speakers, I do not think Ithkuil would  serve the 
    purpose  of being the primary day-to-day language, as I agree the language would quickly 
    degenerate  into a “vulgar” form due  to its 
    complexity.  I see Ithkuil’s hypothetical usage as being a specialized language  for specific purposes where 
    exactitude  and clarity of cognitive intention is called for, and to make deliberate obfuscation difficult, e.g., political debate, the  teaching and 
    discussion  of scientific disciplines, the discussion of philosophy, the written  presentation and 
    preservation  of history. As such, it would be a “learned” 
    language  (like learning a computer programming language or the predicate calculus) whose structure would be 
    consciously  preserved by its speakers. An analogy might be the way that  Classical Latin continued to be used for over a milennium after the death of its last native spearker for academic and religious purposes. A similar analogy is the use of Modern Standard Arabic (essentially a modernized version of Classical Arabic) in official and academic contexts<span class="style10">.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style13">Most Ithkuil morphemes (i.e., units of meaning) are only a single syllable, even a single phoneme, in length. Doesn’t this lack of morpho-phonological redundancy create a  problem given that ambient noise or mispronunciation could easily prevent comprehension or change the meaning of a word or sentence?</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Other than the difficulty of pronunciation, the  issues of signal-to-noise ratio and non-redundancy are  the most frequent criticisms of the language. I don’t consider these to really be a problem for the following reasons: </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">(1) As stated in the answer to the previous question, I see the  contexts in which a hypothetical Ithkuil-speaking community would utilize the language as very limited and highly specialized, in which there would be little, if any ambient, noise; </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">(2) the issue of mispronunciation is no different than for any learner of a foreign language, and Ithkuil’s inventory of 58 phonemes pales in comparison to the number of phonemes in several Caucasian languagues or  Khoi-San languages of Africa&#8212;if a person can  pronounce Chechen or Abkhaz or !Xóõ, they can likely pronounce Ithkuil; </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10"> (3) the precedent for a low signal-to-noise ratio and lack of morpho-phonological redundancy is well established in natural languages, e.g., the phonetic difference between English <em>I can do it</em> versus <em>I can’t do it</em>, or <em>He’s a natural</em> versus <em>He’s unnatural, </em>or<em> I got him first </em>versus<em> I got in first,</em> or <em>a neurotic's mothering</em> versus <em>an erotic smothering</em>. And many languages (e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Caucasian_languages" target="_blank">Northwest Caucasian languages</a>) are replete with single-phoneme morphemes, e.g., the Ubykh single-word sentence <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><strong>want<sup>w</sup>aan</strong></span> <em>they give you to him</em>, which contains six   phonemes,  each of which is a separate morpheme:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="style10"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/w/</span> -   2nd singular absolutive </li>
    <li class="style10"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/a/</span> -   3rd singular dative </li>
    <li class="style10"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/n/</span> -   3rd ergative </li>
    <li class="style10"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/t<sup>w</sup>/</span> - to give </li>
    <li class="style10"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/aa/</span> - ergative plural </li>
    <li class="style10"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/n/</span> -   present tense </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="style10">If such single-phoneme morphemes are good enough for  real-world natural languages, they’re good enough for Ithkuil.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style10"><span class="style14"> How long and how hard have you practiced to pronounce Ithkuil sentences ?</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">The old version of the language would take me about three or four attempts to be able to speak an entire Ithkuil  sentence without 
    making  a mistake, as often due to the tones as due to the “exotic” consonants. The problem with pronouncing tones correctly was especially acute for Ilaksh, which utilized tone shifts much more prominently than Ithkuil. The new version of the language is much easier to pronounce for me than either of its predecessors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style10"><span class="style14"> How long does it take for you to make an Ithkuil sentence?</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">It  takes me up to ten minutes to translate a simple sentence if the necessary word-roots/stems already exist; much longer if new word-roots/stems are required, as the creation of roots takes careful thinking and planning (see the next question below). Long  complex sentences can take up to half an hour. It then takes another five to fifteen minutes to look up the  rules for writing  the sentence in the script depending on the length of the sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style13">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style13">  What  is your criteria for choosing word roots ? How do you build the taxonomy of 
  concepts  ?</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify" class="style10">There  are essentially two criteria: (1) adaptability to the derivational structures  of the morphology  and (2) consideration for what cognitive psychologists and cognitive linguists  call “base-level” categorization.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">The  first criterion can basically be explained by performing the following  analysis: say I need an 
    Ithkuil  translation for the English word X. Before I simply create a root meaning X, is  there any 
    way  I can use Ithkuil morphological categories or the 150 or so suffix categories  to derive this 
    word  from a more general or primary word? If so, can that more general or primary  word in turn 
    be  derived from another? And so, before one goes and create an Ithkuil root for “book” one  first 
    remembers  that a book is a collection or pages of writing bound together in a coherent  fashion by 
    which  to convey a superset of information beyond the content of any specific page of  the book. 
    Well,  Ithkuil morphology has all sorts of categories for designating coherent gestalt  entities 
    formed  from interconnected subcomponents, so we realize we don’t need a word for book. 
    Instead,  all we need is the root for “writing/written  message” declined into appropriate 
    Configuraton  and Affiliation categories, with consideration for the Context category given  that 
    the  resulting entity only functions within the context of human social structures,  with consideration  for an additional suffix indicating that the entity has a container-like  covering, etc., etc.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10"> As  for the second criterion, base-level categorization, this is best explained by  example. Let’s take  animals. First of all, identifying animals means dealing with a hierarchical  taxonomy ranging  from general to specific, for example:</p>
  <div align="justify">
    <ul>
      <li class="style10">  mammal </li>
      <li class="style10"> equine</li>
      <li class="style10">horse</li>
      <li class="style10"> thoroughbred</li>
      <li class="style10">Arabian  thoroughbred</li>
      <li class="style10">Arabian  thoroughbred gelding</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Another example:</p>
  <div align="justify">
    <ul>
      <li class="style10">mammal</li>
      <li class="style10">primate</li>
      <li class="style10">monkey</li>
      <li class="style10">chimpanzee</li>
      <li class="style10">male  chimpanzee</li>
      <li><span class="style10">pet  male chimpanzee</span><br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">So,  how should Ithkuil deal with such  hierarchies? Research  by cognitive psychologists show that human cognition tends to manifest base-level categorization, where a particular element in the hierarchy is  psychologically 
    viewed  as being the most easy concept to grasp and understand, and is usually the  first concept 
    of  the hierarchy learned by children, and usually represents the shortest, most  common word in 
    the  speaker’s language of all the elements in the hierarchy. This base-level category (what 
    psychologists  call the most cognitively “salient” category level) usually appears  in the middle of 
    the  range from general to specific. In the examples above, it would be the words  “horse” and “monkey.”  Therefore, a person is far more likely to spontaneously say “Hey, there’s  a  
    horse  in my yard!” rather than “Hey, there’s an equine in my yard” or  “There’s an Arabian 
    thoroughbred.”  Likewise, a child at the zoo is more likely to say either “I want to see  the 
    monkeys!”  or “I want to see the snakes!” than “I want to see the  primates” or “I want to see the 
    rattlesnakes  and the pythons!”    </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Secondly,  one of the purposes of Ithkuil is efficiency in communication (you might think  of this 
    simplistically  as the “Speedtalk” factor). Since base-level cognition  implies that the concept “dog”  or “spider” is going to be used by people more often and in more  contexts than “canine” or “arachnid”  it doesn’t make sense for Ithkuil to only have roots for “canine” and  “arachnid” with 
    the  words for “dog” and “spider” being simply derivations of these  roots. It defeats the purpose of 
    morpho-phonological  efficiency if to say “I fear spiders”, an Ithkuil speaker has to say  literally “I 
    fear  the-most-common-arachnid-example.”    </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Now, the reader may think that surely Ithkuil’s 3600 roots do not  allow for base-level naming all of the animals in the world. No, of course not.  But there is no need. Despite the thousands of different names of animal  species, only 
    about  fifty or so are common enough to qualify for such base-level  naming. Other 
    animals  are simply not sufficienlty common or well-known to require such. 
    Therefore,  it makes sense that Ithkuil have a root for “bear” but it can probably do  without a 
    separate  root for “wolverine” which it can name by derivational means from  another root (quite 
    possibly  “bear”). We see this in English with names of animals that are derivations or  compounds 
    such  as “polar bear” and “sea lion” (the latter having nothing  at all to do with a lion!). There 
    simply  aren’t any base-level single-word names for these animals in English. 
    Finally,  by establishing this base-level category at the level of the root  in Ithkuil (instead of the 
    stem),  it allows me to use the stems to refer to contextual and omplementary manifestations  of 
    the  root, i.e., male versus female, wild versus domesticated, the animal itself  versus its function as  food/prey/resource. In turn, I can use the SSD derivational suffix to generate  words for associated  concepts and products such as eggs, oil, fat, fur/feathers, flesh/meat, etc.</p>

<p align="justify" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10"><span class="style14">  Have you invented other languages?</span><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Prior  to beginning the language which eventually evolved into Ithkuil, I invented  several sketches  of other languages mostly for fun. They were not serious efforts to address the purposes  which Ithkuil addresses. Since 1978, all my conlanging efforts have been oriented  toward creating the language which eventually became Ithkuil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="style10"><span class="style14"><br />
  Is the 2011 version of the language the final version of the language?</span><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">To the extent that I can foresee, yes, this new version for 2011 will be the final version of the language. I have neither the desire nor intention to redesign it again, especially given that I am finally pleased with this new revision (unlike the revision into Ilaksh,  which I was never satisfied with).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style13">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style13"><span class="style14">  Will you continue to work on the language?</span><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">I intend to continue adding more examples, enhance the explanations, and add new entries to the Lexicon on an ongoing (albeit perhaps infrequent) basis. I also plan on eventually developing a section on how Ithkuil handles mathematical concepts and equations. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Additionally, I will be adding longer texts to the <a href="texts.html">Texts</a> page of the site, as time and interest permit. This Texts chapter will eventually showcase original Ithkuil poetry that I envision composing in the next few years; it is my belief that the morpho-semantic flexibility, richness and conciseness of the language would allow for a kind of poetry not possible in other languages, and I am looking forward to exploring this.</p>

<p align="justify" class="style13"> What&#8217;s with the clowns?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style10">Just indulging my warped sense of humor. I am fascinated by all aspects of life that have a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction quality, and I consider the phenomenon of clowns to fall into this category. I mean, think about it ... really.... </p>
  <p align="center" class="style10"><img src="images/Clown5.jpg" width="76" height="88" align="top" /></p>
  <p align="justify" class="style10">Anyway, I have peppered the Ithkuil grammar with their ridiculous and ghastly visages plus clown-related example sentences as a reminder not to take anything, including myself, too seriously.</p>
