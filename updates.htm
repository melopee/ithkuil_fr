      <td valign="top"><p>I have finally determined a way to address the issue regarding ambiguous consonantal combinations in the Ithkuil writing system, specifically how to distinguish combinations such as -pg- from -bg-, -kt- from -gt-, etc. when writing the C<sub>r</sub> root.</p>

<p>In analyzing the script, I realize that the character extension elements shown in Table 52 (in Section 11.3.4.1 of the Grammar) are redundant, given that they can be much more easily shown using the subscript diacritics shown in Table 53.  The original intent of these Table 53 diacritics was that they be used only for tri-consonantal and tetra-consonantal roots, I realize there’s no reason not to use them in biconsonantal roots as well, which then obviates the need for the character extensions shown in Table 52.   By rendering these Table 52 extensions redundant, it makes them available for use to disambiguate the k/g, p/b, t/d problem. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Table 52 elements are hereby reassigned to indicate the following values <strong>[THE LIST BELOW WAS CORRECTED ON JAN 29, 2016]</strong>: </p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + w will now indicate b + C</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + y will no longer be used</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + l will now indicate d + C</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + r will now indicate g + C</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + &#345; will now indicate &#380; + C</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + m will now indicate j + C</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + n will now indicate dh + C</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + v will now indicate &#382; + C and the extension shown in Table 51 for &#382; + C will no longer be used</p>
<p>The extension previously indicating C + &#328; will no longer be used</p>
<p>As a result of the above, those character extension elements in Table 51 of the grammar which currently indicate dual/alternate values will now only be used to indicate their primary value. </p>

<p>Note that, using the subscript diacritics in lieu of the now-obsolete values of the Table 52 character extension elements, might at first glance give rise to ambiguities.  For example does the consonantal character for /s/ plus an extension indicating prefixed /k/- plus a subscript diacritic indicating +/n/ mean -KNS- or -KSN-?  However, no ambiguity exists, as -KNS- is not a valid combination for a Cr root.  So when interpreting how to read such combinations, the reader must bear in mind Ithkuil phonotactical constraints. </p>

<p>Note also that, with the above changes, quite a number of the existing examples of Ithkuil script throughout the Ithkuil website and grammar book are now unfortunately erroneous.  I will correct these errors when I (eventually) publish the revised website and grammar book. </p>

         <p>Also, an update on the music situation:  I've now completed recording the music for two of the six songs and have them ready as draft instrumental mixes.  They will not be turned into final mixes until the vocals have been recorded, which should be sometime in the next couple of months in my musician friend's studio.  I'm anxious to start recording the third song, but I made a promise to the Ithkuil subreddit group that I'd look into formalizing and improving how Ithkuil handles mathematics, which will be a big distraction for me.  Since I'm ahead of schedule on recording the music (I thought I'd only have one song done by now), I think I'll work on the third song for a few weeks, then take a break and work on Ithkuil mathematics.

     </td>
      <td valign="top"><p>For whatever reason, I woke up this morning with several major flashes of insight regarding Ithkuil, the details of which I’ve spent the entire morning working out.  As a result, I am announcing some small but significant structural changes to the grammar.  The details are as follows: </p>


<p><strong>ITEM ONE:  A flaw discovered in the Morpho-Phonology! </strong></p>

<p>I’ve discovered a flaw in the morpho-phonology involving the Slot I of the formative.  I realized that a hypothetical Ithkuil word like <strong>skaherad</strong> is ambiguous, in that the word could represent either of the following: </p>

<p><strong>sk - a - h - e - r - a – d</strong><br>
C<sub>v</sub>-V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>g</sub>-V<sub>r</sub>-C<sub>r</sub>-V<sub>c</sub>-C<sub>a</sub><br>
(i.e., the following slots filled:  I - II - III - IV - VII - VIII - X) </p>

<p><strong> sk - a - he - r - ad</strong><br>
C<sub>r</sub>-V<sub>c</sub>-C<sub>i</sub>+V<sub>i</sub>-C<sub>a</sub>-V<sub>x</sub>C<br>
 (i.e., the following slots filled:  VII - VIII - IX - X - XI) </p>

<p>I’ve traced the ambiguity to the presence of the <strong>C<sub>v</sub></strong> Phase/Sanction/Illocution affix in Slot I.  It has to go.  Therefore, I officially announce . . . (drumroll please) . . . that the <strong>C<sub>v</sub></strong> affix is no longer permissible in Slot I of a formative.  It can only appear in Slot V in the absence of an incorporated root.  If the formative contains an incorporated root taking up Slots V and VI, then <strong>C<sub>v</sub></strong> must be shown via Slot C in a verbal adjunct instead. </p>

<p>This essentially means that Slot I no longer exists, which would entail renumbering all the subsequent slots accordingly (e.g., Slot II becomes Slot I, Slot III becomes Slot II, etc.).  However, given the confusion this would cause to those persons who have spent significant time learning the slot structure and its labels (yours truly included), we will simply consider Slot I to be “vacant” or “dormant” for now, eh? </p>


<p><strong>ITEM TWO:  Introducing a new morphological category:  Register</strong></p>

<p>The question has been raised here and there on various online fora as to how to deal with direct speech in Ithkuil, as in the sentence <em> ‘She turned to him and said “take care of yourself”’ </em> as opposed to the indirect speech equivalent of <em> ‘She turned and told him to take care of himself.’ </em>  I’ve pondered the matter now and again but have never really dealt with it in terms of finding a solution.  Suddenly, the answer came to me this morning and now, much to my surprise, I am introducing a brand new morphological category, which for lack of a better term, I shall call “Register.”  (Like most Ithkuil grammatical terms, I am simply appropriating this nomenclature from existing linguistics terminology, but, as usual, the Ithkuil category has little, if anything, to do with the traditional definition of the term).  So, what is this new Register category? </p>

<p>In Ithkuil, the category of Register will indicate intra-sentence or intra-narrative changes in the mode of personal communication from a general narrative to instead indicate either one’s personal cogitation/deliberation, an unwilled or subjective impression, direct speech, or a parenthetical “aside”.   Register will be indicated phonologically by tone distinctions.  The first word of a phrase carrying a specific register will have one of five tones, and the last word of the phrase carrying that register will have rising tone to indicate termination of the register.  Here are the specifics: </p>

<p><strong>NRR – NARRATIVE</strong><br>
Tone marking:  falling (default) <br>
Description:  The default register, indicating a general narrative statement.  Also used for formal narration, as when telling the events a story from an omniscient narrator’s perspective. </p>

<p><strong>DSV – DISCURSIVE</strong><br>
Tone marking: high<br>
Description: Indicates a phrase/statement represents direct speech, as in <em> ‘His wife turned to him and said <strong> “You’ve forgotten your hat.”’ </strong></em>” </p>

<p><strong>PTH – PARENTHETICAL</strong><br>
Tone marking:  low<br>
Description: Indicates a phrase/statement is a parenthetical aside, or the equivalent to an in-line footnote, as in <em> ‘All equine species in Eurasia <strong> (we needn’t bother with those in the Americas) </strong>can be shown to be quadrupeds</em>,’  or <em> ‘I generally prefer coffee to tea on summer afternoons – <strong>over ice, of course </strong>– but sometimes only a beer will do, </em>’ or <em> ‘That artist’s landscapes <strong> (you should see his portraits!) </strong> are simply sublime.’ </em> </p>

<p><strong>COG – COGITANT</strong><br>
Tone marking:  falling-rising<br>
Description:  Indicates a phrase/statement represents silent thoughts or beliefs.  Equivalent to various devices in natural languages for indicating silent thoughts/beliefs within a narrative, as in the use of italics within a written paragraph, or the sudden interjection of a character’s disembodied voice on the soundtrack of a film/video while the character visually doesn’t open their mouth. </p>

<p><strong>IPR – IMPRESSIONISTIC</strong><br>
Tone marking:  rising-falling<br>
Description: I ndicates a phrase/statement represents the imagination, subjective impressions, or unwilled “wandering” thoughts of the party being referenced in the phrase/statement.  Equivalent in natural languages to a narrator suddenly interjecting a subjective description within a statement, as in <em> ‘The little girl ran down the hillside, <strong>a feeling of joy in her heart</strong>, then leaped into the arms of her father.’ </em> </p>

<p>NOTE:  Since it is not possible for an Ithkuil word to carry more than one morphologically significant tone (see Sec. 1.3.2), if a non-default register (i.e., a register other than NAR) is to be applied to a single word only, this is indicated by the fact that there will be no subsequent indication that the Register has terminated, i.e., there will be no subsequent word carrying rising tone prior to the end of the sentence or prior to a new/subsequent change to a non-NARRATIVE register.  It is this absence of the register-termination tone marker that retrospectively indicates that only the initial word of the previous non-NARRATIVE utterance/statement carried that particular register. </p>



<p><strong>ITEM THREE:  Changes in how the categories of Version and Validation are phonologically marked. </strong></p>

<p>As a result of using tone to mark the new category of Register described above, the existing phonological markers for the category of Version (see Sec. 5.8) will have to be changed from tone to something else.  In reviewing the possibilities, I have decided to change the markings for both the category of Version and the category of Validation (see Sec. 5.9) as well.  These changes will entail the creation of a new Hearsay suffix, as well as a revamping of the existing SCS suffix.  The details are as follows: </p>

<p>Both Version and Validation will be primarily shown via a consonantal affix in Slot III.  The affix for Validation will continue to be labelled <strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> and will have priority over affixes showing Version.  The Version affix will be arbitrarily labelled <strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong>.  If Slot III is already occupied by <strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong>, then Version must be shown by the SCS suffix (-rk/kr-) in Slot XI.  The SCS suffix has been re-formulated to accommodate all six Versions. </p>

<p>The <strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> Version affix in Slot III can only appear if the formative’s Validation is in its default value CNF-Confirmative.  Conversely, the default Version, PRC-Processual is now completely unmarked, so that if a formative has both default CNF Validation and default PRC Version, it will be the CNF Validation that will occupy Slot III if required by the presence of a Valence affix in Slot II. </p>

<p>The number of <strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> Validations is being reduced from fourteen to six.  This is because the existing nine hearsay values are being collapsed into a single value; the Ithkuil speaker/writer will instead now have to option to specify the exact nature of the hearsay via a new Hearsay suffix in Slot XI.  The six values for Validation are now as follows: </p>

<p><strong>CNF – CONFIRMATIVE</strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> affix:  glottal stop + h  <br>
NOTE:  CNF Validation is normally unmarked; this suffix only appears if a Valence prefix occupies Slot II of the formative.  Also:  this suffix is supplanted by any non-default <strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> Version affix. </p>

<p><strong>AFM – AFFIRMATIVE</strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> affix:  glottal stop + y</p>

<p><strong>RPT – REPORTIVE</strong> <br>
<strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> affix:  w-</p>

<p><strong>INF – INFERENTIAL</strong> <br>
<strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> affix:  glottal stop + w</p>

<p><strong>ITU – INTUITIVE</strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> affix:  hh-</p>

<p><strong>PSM – PRESUMPTIVE</strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>g</sub></strong> affix:  y-<br>
NOTE:  This is the new affix that collapses the previous nine hearsay Validations into one.  If exact specification of the hearsay source is desired, a new HSY-Hearsay VxC suffix is available for use in Slot XI.  If this HSY suffix is employed, then use of the PSM Cg affix in Slot III is optional (i.e., it can be supplanted by a Cn Version affix or Slot III can be left unfilled if there is no Valence affix in Slot II). </p>

<p>The new HSY Hearsay suffix is <strong>-&#328;&#355;</strong>.  Its nine degrees match the previous nine hearsay Validations shown in Table 13(b) in Sec. 5.9. </p>

<p>The six new <strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> Version affixes for Slot III are as follows: </p>

<p><strong>PRC – PROCESSUAL</strong> <br>
[unmarked] </p>

<p><strong>CPT – COMPLETIVE </strong> <br>
<strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> affix:  -h-</p>

<p><strong>INE – INEFFECTUAL </strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> affix:  -hw-</p>

<p><strong>INC – INCOMPLETIVE </strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> affix:  -hm-</p>

<p><strong>PST – POSITIVE </strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> affix:  -hn-</p>

<p>E<strong>FC – EFFECTIVE </strong><br>
<strong>C<sub>n</sub></strong> affix:  -hr-</p>

<p>If necessary to show Version using the SCS suffix because of the presence of Cg, the new values of the SCS suffix are as follows: </p>

<p><strong>SCS  -rk / -kr</strong>  Degree of Success/Failure<br>
1. total failure in; utterly fail to<br>
2. INC version<br>
3. INE version<br>
4. certain to fail in, expected to fail in; anticipated/expected failure to<br>
5. CPT version<br>
6. certain to succeed in, expected to succeed in; anticipated/expected success in<br>
7. PST version<br>
8. EFC version<br>
9. overwhelming success in; overwhelmingly successful</p>


<p><strong>ITEM FOUR:  Availability of new roots</strong></p>

<p>As a result of the changes above to permissible values in Slot III, the number of impermissible <strong>C<sub>r</sub></strong> root forms as stated in Table 3 (in Sec. 2.1.1) and in Sec. 2.2.1 is now reduced from fourteen to eight.  The remaining prohibited root forms are <strong>-w-, -y-, -h-, -hw-, -hr-, -hh-, -hn-, -hm-</strong>.</p>


<p><strong>ITEM FIVE:  Correction of Rule in Sec. 5.5</strong></p>

<p>In Sec. 5.5, just above Table 11, there is a note indicating two methods by which one disambiguates (or correctly parses) the structure of a formative when Slots V and VI are filled.  I have now realized the information given is overly complicated and not entirely correct.  Specifically, the second note regarding use of the Slot IX infix <strong>-wë-</strong> in the presence of an incorporated root in Slots V and VI is both unnecessary and incorrect.  Any incorporated root already mandatorily requires the presence of a Format/Context affix in Slot XII, so there is no need for any other means of indicating the function of Slots V and VI in that situation.  It is also incorrect because the infix <strong> -wë-</strong> can also be used to increase the number of syllables in the word if necessary for purposes of applying antepenultimate or pre-antepenultimate stress (see the paragraph below Table 10 in Sec. 5.4.1). </p>

<p>As a result, the only rule needed is for when Slots V and VI are occupied by the C<sub>v</sub> Phase/Sanction/Illocution affix and the V<sub>L</sub> Valence affix.  Specifically, the note above Table 11 in Sec. 5.5 should be simplified and corrected to say that a glottal stop is required immediately following the Vr affix in Slot IV whenever Slots V and VI are filled by the C<sub>v</sub> and the V<sub>L</sub> valence affix.  No such glottal stop is required if Slots V and VI are occupied by an incorporated root C<sub>x</sub>+V<sub>p</sub>. </p>


<p>I will eventually incorporate all of the above changes into the forthcoming Grammar Supplement. </p>

<p>p.s.  Work proceeds smoothly but slowly on the music production. </p>

      <td valign="top"><p>I have decided to post the lyrics to the last of the songs I composed, the one entitled "Synaesthesia."  Rather than translate lines already written in English, this time I composed the lyrics directly in Ithkuil, which resulted in some very rich imagery and use of the language to its fullest extent.  Furthermore, I was able to work out a (more-or-less) tetrameter verse for the English translation. I've yet to add a morphological analysis, but I'm posting the lyrics anyway for those who may have an interest in working out the morphology for themselves.

      <td valign="top"><p>I’ve now finished the lyrics to five of the six songs of my music project.  Yesterday I sat down to begin writing the lyrics to the sixth and final song and I found myself thinking about my visit with the psychoneticists in Kiev, Ukraine, back in 2011.  While there, I was asked to create an Ithkuil word for “synaesthesia.”  Belatedly, I have done so and have decided to use it as the title of the song. </p>

<p>In researching the exact meaning of the word, I discovered that many scholars studying the phenomenon consider the word inappropriate and would prefer the term “ideaesthesia”, as the nature of synaesthesia does not really involve the mind translating one sense impression into another, but rather translating thoughts/ideas/concepts into sense impressions.  Therefore, the Ithkuil word is <strong>ôrödyagzou</strong>, which literally translates as something like “the concept (and wondrous experience thereof) of varied sets of sense impressions resulting from concurrent ideas/thoughts being considered”. </p>

<p>The concept appears in the song lyrics contained within some very interesting (and powerful) words such as the one below: </p>

<strong>uorödyoi’gzuxharçiámtixtou</strong>
<p>P3S3/DYN-inc.stem:‘thought.or.idea.considered’/P3S2/IFL-‘imagined.sensory.experience’-PTL-NRM/PRX/A/AGG/VAR-SCO<sub>1</sub>/9-MD05<sub>1</sub>/5-CNM<sub>2</sub>/9-NEW<sub>1</sub>/1-RSL/AMG-IFL</p>

<p>The literal translation of the above word is something like:  “If there could be an act of embodiment of a new and wondrous synergistic expansion of synaesthesia”, which I will word more naturally (for the eventual lyric sheet) as: <p>

<p><em>‘If one could embody an emergence of new synaesthesia’</em></p>

<p>The interesting thing about this sixth song, is that this is the first of the songs where I am deliberately composing the words without regard for how they fit into the music, as I’ve already decided that the existing music for this song does not match the subject matter of the lyrics at all. </p>

<p>I have therefore decided to shelve the music I wrote for this song and will be composing new music later to go with the lyrics after I’ve finished them.  This is the reverse of how the other five songs have been written and should prove an interesting experiment.  I have a feeling that, as a result, the song may end up sounding rather different than the other five. </p>

     I have now completed lyrics to four of the six songs.  I’ve written further about the experience in a couple of posts on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/" target="_blank">Ithkuil subreddit</a> for those interested (and have also provided a glimpse at more of the lyrics).  At any rate, working with the language again after more than a two-year hiatus, I have discovered a few aspects of grammar that need, ahem, improvement, as well as an error.</p>

<p>First of all, the example sentence at the end of Sec. 8.1.4 in the Grammar, illustrating use of the switch-reference suffix, has an error in it.  The fourth word should be <strong> èkšülöt’</strong> (not <strong>ekšülé&#328;&#355;</strong>) and the morphological analysis below the sentence should show the suffix on this word as TPF<sub>1</sub>/2, not TPF<sub>1</sub>/3. </p>

<p>More importantly: </p>

<p>I’ve decided to augment the Ithkuil grammar to allow case stacking—the ability to assign two cases simultaneously to a formative (or to a case-frame).  This is necessary to accurately translate sentences like the following: </p>

<p> <em> ‘I jog every day except in case of illness.’</em> or <em> ‘I jog every day except during (an) illness.’</em> </p>

<p>In Ithkuil, “except (for) X” is expressed by the EXCEPTIVE case (Sec. 4.5.30), while the idea of “in case of X” is expressed by the POSTULATIVE case (Sec. 4.5.28) and “during X” by the CONCURSIVE case (Sec. 4.6.3).  So how do we apply two different cases to the formative which translates ‘illness’ when translating the above sentence?  Current Ithkuil grammar would require such a sentence to be expressed paraphrastically as something like <em> ‘I jog every day except that I don’t jog during illness.’</em> </p>

<p>To allow for two (or more) cases to be assigned to the same formative (or case-frame), I am now introducing <em><strong>case adjuncts</strong></em>, a new kind of adjunct which signifies the case of the following case-frame (or formative if there is nothing but a formative between the case adjunct and the end of the sentence) which may, in turn have its own separate case.  The form of these case adjuncts are based on Table 28 (in Section 8.1.2.2) as follows: </p>

<p>For cases 1 through 48 (as per Table 28), the form of the adjunct is the consonant <strong>-w-</strong> plus <strong>Vc</strong> as indicated in Table 28.  Alternately, a “full” form is available consisting of the <strong>Vc</strong> plus the syllable <strong>-wa</strong>.  Examples: <strong>wa</strong> = OBLIQUE case (or <strong>awa</strong>), <strong>woe</strong> = REFERENTIAL case (or <strong>oewa</strong>), <strong>wëu</strong> = VOCATIVE case (or <strong>ëúwa</strong>), etc.  Cases where <strong>Vc</strong> is <strong>-û-</strong> (i.e., the OGN case) or where <strong>Vc</strong> is a bisyllabic form beginning with <strong>-u-</strong> (i.e., the MED, APL, PUR, and CSD cases), must use the full form (in order to avoid phonetically undesirable forms such as <strong>wû</strong> or <strong>wuo</strong>, etc.) </p>

<p>Cases 49 through 96 (as per Table 28) take the same forms except that the consonant <strong>-y-</strong> is substituted for <strong>-w-</strong>.  Cases where <strong>Vc</strong> is <strong>-î-</strong> (i.e., the ELP case) or where <strong>Vc</strong> is a bisyllabic form beginning with <strong>-i-</strong> (i.e., the LOC, ORI, PSV, and ALL cases), must use the full form (in order to avoid phonetically undesirable forms such as <strong>yî</strong> or <strong>yio</strong>, etc.) </p>

<p>So now the original English sentence can be translated as follows using the EXCEPTIVE case adjunct <strong> ya</strong> in conjunction with POSTULATIVE case on the following formative: </p>

<p><strong>Aigwaloekç &nbsp; tu &nbsp; &#380;o’aluq<sup>h</sup> &nbsp; ya &nbsp; egloi’löat. </strong> </br>
DYN-‘run’-[OBL]-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-FRC<sub>2</sub>/4 &nbsp; &nbsp;  1m-IND &nbsp; &nbsp;  (STA)-‘day’-ACS-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-INL<sub>1</sub>/9</br>   
EXC  &nbsp; &nbsp; STA-‘illness’-PTL-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-ATT/1m</br>
<em> ‘I jog every day except in case of illness.’ </em> </p>

<p>Additionally, I have decided that the tone of these case adjuncts will be used to indicate which word following the case adjunct constitutes the topic of the following case-frame.  Specifically: </p>

<p>falling tone = no specific element topicalized</br>
high tone = the first word following the adjunct is topicalized</br>
rising tone = the second word following the adjunct is topicalized</br>
low tone = the third word following the adjunct is topicalized</br>
rising-falling tone = the fourth word following the adjunct is topicalized</br>
falling-rising tone = the fifth word following the adjunct is topicalized</p>

<p>This new ability to stack cases in Ithkuil also allows for alternative ways to construct case-frames which are potentially more elegant than what Ithkuil grammar previously allowed.  For example, note the following English sentence: </p>

<p><em> ‘She looks at the book about rats (that) I captured.’</em> </p>

<p>The Ithkuil translation can be either of the following: </p>

<p><strong>Ixal &nbsp; qu &nbsp; ultán&#316; &nbsp; çt’oert &nbsp; ikdai’rt &nbsp; eçt<sup>h</sup>o. </strong> </br>
DYN-‘see’-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL &nbsp; &nbsp;  3a-IND  &nbsp; &nbsp; STA-‘page.of.writing’-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/SEG/COA-FML</br>
(STA)-‘rat’-REF-NRM/DEL/U/CSL/AGG-IFL &nbsp; &nbsp;  DYN/FRAMED-‘capture’-COR-NRM/DEL/U/CSL/AGG-IFL </br>1m/ERG+ua/ABS</p>

<p><strong>Ixal &nbsp; qu &nbsp; ultán&#316; &nbsp; íkdoert &nbsp; to &nbsp; çt’ertût’. </strong> </br>
DYN-‘see’-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL &nbsp; &nbsp;  3a-IND &nbsp; &nbsp;  STA-‘page.of.writing’-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/SEG/COA-TPF<sub>1</sub>/3-FML </br>
DYN/FRAMED-‘capture’-REF-NRM/DEL/U/CSL/AGG-IFL  &nbsp; &nbsp; 1m-ERG &nbsp; &nbsp;  (STA)-‘rat’-ABS-NRM/DEL/U/CSL/AGG-TPF<sub>1</sub>/6-IFL</p>

<p>The first Ithkuil sentence above literally begins with “she looks at the book about rats” followed by a case-frame in CORRELATIVE case (equivalent to a relative clause in English) which states “I captured them.”  So literally:  <em> ‘She looks at the book about rats that I captured them.’</em>  The extra personal reference adjunct ua/ABS “them” is necessary, otherwise the Ithkuil sentence wouldn’t have a way to indicate that what was captured were the rats. </p>

<p>The second Ithkuil sentence literally states “she looks at the book”, followed by a case-frame in REFERENTIAL case which states “rats (are what) I captured” or alternately “it is rats (that) I captured” where the word “rats” bears a TPF suffix indicating it is the topic of the case-frame.  So literally:  <em> ‘She looks at the book – it’s about rats (that) I captured.’ </em> Without the TPF suffix on “rats”, the Ithkuil sentence would translate as <em> ‘She looks at the book about me having captured rats’</em>, which does not mean quite the same thing as the original English sentence. </p>

<p>With the new ability to stack cases using case adjuncts, we can render a new translation of the English sentence using the REFERENTIAL case adjunct <strong>woe</strong> (or <strong>oewa</strong>)  as follows: </p>

<p><strong>Ixal &nbsp; qu &nbsp; ultán&#316; &nbsp; ¯woe &nbsp; çt’ert &nbsp; ikdart &nbsp; to. </strong> </br>
DYN-‘see’-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL  &nbsp; &nbsp; 3a-IND &nbsp; &nbsp;  STA-‘page.of.writing’-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/SEG/COA-FML</br>   
REF &nbsp; &nbsp;  (STA)-‘rat’-ABS-NRM/DEL/U/CSL/AGG-IFL  &nbsp; &nbsp;  DYN-‘capture’-[OBL]-NRM/DEL/U/CSL/AGG-IFL  &nbsp; &nbsp; 1m-ERG</br>
<em> ‘She looks at the book about rats (that) I captured.’</em></p>

<p>Due to the presence of the case adjunct, there is no need to indicate FRAMED relation on the verb ‘capture’.  Additionally, by using the case adjunct, it allows us to show ‘rats’ as the topic of the case-frame via tone (high tone indicates the word immediately following the case adjunct is the topic of the case-frame), eliminating the need to use a TPF suffix to indicate the topicalization.  Note that use of the case adjunct to mark the beginning of a case frame also eliminates the requirement that case-frames have verb-initial word order, thus allowing pragmatic relations such as semantic focus and topicalization within the case-frame to be shown via word order. </p>

<p>I will be adding this new information on case adjuncts to the forthcoming Grammar Supplement I plan to add to this website before the end of this year.

     </td>
      <td valign="top"><p>So far I’ve finished writing lyrics for three of the six songs of my music project.  One of the three songs is a direct translation from English-language lyrics written by my brother.  The other two are original Ithkuil lyrics inspired by thoughts I wrote down in English.  It’s been interesting finding ways to translate from an English source within the constraints of the music.  It should be noted that I do not consider these lyrics to be poetry per se, as the lines do not follow a strict meter given that many of the syllables are meant to be stretched across two or more beats or multiple notes, or paused for rests in the music, etc.  (Being progressive-rock, the fact that the music is often in time signatures such as 5/4, 6/8, and 7/8 doesn’t help either.)</p>
          <p>If these were meant to be real poems, I’d demand a strict meter and overt rules for consonantal and vocalic alliteration.  Nevertheless, the lyrics do display a fair amount of rhyming on the last syllable of each line as well as a loose internal alliteration.  Here is an example (and, no, I haven’t checked it yet for errors so it’s still potentially subject to change):</p>
          <p><span class="style13">O&#328;&#328; &nbsp; âândairpöt’ &nbsp; îp &nbsp; ütvaqayûlo<br/>
             iùlái’št’axta &nbsp; twiam-mt’uo<br/>  
             enk’ala&#328; &nbsp; ûkt &nbsp; a&#269;’át &nbsp; &#355;iuteowa<br/>
             a’tiçpralot<sup>h</sup>ukra&#328; &nbsp; öìçt<sup>h</sup>eya</span></p>
          <p><em>“However, with this information, there would be this other person who is myself<br/>
             who might eventually choose to begin saying things I never said,<br/>
             might steer clear of certain doorways as I did not,<br/>
             and befriend strangers I’ll never meet”</em></p>
          <p>So far I’ve created half a dozen new roots and three new suffixes while writing the lyrics.  [NOTE:  the above passage uses two new roots:  <strong>-TV-</strong> ‘one’s “self” (as a metaphorical object of reflection)’, and <strong>-&#327;K’-</strong> ‘make way for / keep clear of’.]   After I’m done, I plan to add the new roots to the existing Lexicon Supplement PDF file, and will also be posting a new PDF file called Grammar Supplement where I will be presenting the new suffixes as well as some interesting grammatical innovations I’ve come up with that are not currently discussed in the existing grammar.  For example, astute readers will note the word “&#355;iuteowa” above, a personal reference adjunct meaning “like me” preceded by the DEV/1 affix (reversative “un-”) but in 2nd degree.  By using 2nd degree of this affix, I create a short-cut way of saying that the preceding verbal phrase is linked to the reversative reference; thus, the meaning is essentially “unlike what I do/did” or “like the reverse of what I do/did”.</p>
          <p>The lyrics also provide a corpus of new Ithkuil example phrases and sentences which further illustrate the various morphological categories of the language.  I plan to analyze these examples in the forthcoming Grammar Supplement PDF I will be posting.  Again looking at the above stanza, the line “iùlái’št’axta  twiam-mt’uo” is a good example of the language’s morpho-semantic efficiency:</p>
          <p><span class="style13">iùlái’št’axta &nbsp; twiam-mt’uo</span><br/>
P3/S2/DYN-‘communicate.spoken.content’-FRAMED/NRM/ICP/COR/AGG/ASO/U-NEW<sub>1</sub>/2<br/>   
ASR/CTX/EXV-DCV-HYP/CUL-CSQ</p>
          <p>The phrase fully translates as <em>“who theoretically might eventually go ahead and choose to begin making various statements unsaid before”.</em></p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I find that I have had to sacrifice the representation of stress accent when singing these lyrics.  I can’t find a way to consistently place the lyrics I need within the melodies and rhythms I’ve written while preserving proper stress on the syllables.  So there are lots of stems with FORMAL designation (requiring word-final stress) which are not stressed on the final syllable, and vice-versa for INFORMAL stems.  I’ve decided to rationalize this given that there are plenty of natural languages where stress rules, and even tone requirements (e.g., Mandarin), are dispensed with in singing.  I am likewise ignoring morpho-phonological tone in the music as well, but so far there’s only been a few words with non-falling tone, so the impact is not serious.</p>
          <p>Anyway, three more songs to write lyrics for....</p>
          <p>ALSO:  Since I can no longer access the Ithkuil Facebook community, I’ve begun following the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/" target="_blank">Ithkuil reddit</a> community (for those of you familiar with reddit).  Mostly I lurk, but do occasionally post answers to questions or comment on interesting threads.</p>

      <td valign="top"><p>Joshua Foer’s New Yorker article about Ithkuil has gone a bit viral in terms of re-postings, links, and blog commentary, so I suppose I should offer a couple of corrections and clarifications:</p>
<p>Beyond getting my age wrong, the article states that I “lurk” on Facebook. This may lead some (i.e., the members of the Ithkuil Facebook community) to believe I am seeing their various comments and postings.  I’ve never joined Facebook (and don’t intend to for various reasons) but I used to be able to see entries on the Ithkuil Facebook page and respond as necessary on this Updates page.  However, when Facebook changed to its “Timeline” interface, I found I could no longer uncollapse the comment boxes to meaningfully read the various threads.  Also, I’m told most of the Facebook commentary now occurs in a “private group,” to which I have no access whatsoever.  So, no, I don’t lurk on Facebook because I can’t.</p>
<p>Also:  based on various blog comments I’ve read here and there, apparently some readers of the article have gotten the impression that Ithkuil is supposed to represent some sort of “perfect” language (whatever that’s supposed to mean).  I certainly don’t subscribe to such a presumptuous notion about my work.  Ithkuil is for me nothing more than a private experiment to see the extent to which it might be possible to achieve the design goals mentioned at the beginning of the Introduction page of this website, nothing more.  I originally posted it on the internet just to get some feedback from a few fellow conlangers.</p>
<p>Corollary to the above issue, some readers have apparently gotten the idea that Ithkuil is designed to (theoretically) replace natural languages or be used as an international auxiliary language like Esperanto.  I address this erroneous notion in the FAQ pages of this website.</p>

Note, also, that it in written Ithkuil, the triple-dot &quot;quotation marks&quot; already  indicate  the end of the non-Ithkuil word/phrase so it is unnecessary to otherwise represent it in writing.

        <p>Paul Elaku is inquiring as to how Ithkuil handles WH-questions, e.g., who? what? when? why?, etc. The Ithkuil equivalents are not structured as questions using INTERROGATIVE illocution, but rather as statements using DIRECTIVE illocution. Thus, in Ithkuil, one does not ask &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;What time is it?&quot; &quot;Where is the toilet?&quot; &quot;Who is that woman?&quot; &quot;Which clown was caught stealing?&quot; Instead, an Ithkuil speaker would say &quot;Please tell me your name,&quot; &quot;Please indicate the time of day,&quot; &quot;Indicate the location of the toilet,&quot; &quot;Please identify that woman,&quot; and &quot;Identify the [individual] clown [from the group of clowns] who was caught stealing.&quot;</p>

Technically, there's no reason conceptually that a computer has to function electronically (it just so happens that they do). After all, some of you may recall <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/" target="_blank">Babbadge's  Engines</a>. Therefore, I think the simplified version of the word doesn't really need the <span class="style12">MEC<sub>1</sub>/5 </span>affix. That leaves the  form of the word as   <span class="style17">&acirc;draxhtip&scaron;&iacute;</span><em>&#8220;apparatus designed for  running programs.&#8221;</em></p>
        <p>As for a word for &quot;Internet,&quot; looks like Flo and Anton from the Facebook community rose to the challenge. Flo suggests <strong>eqa&scaron;kon&icirc;&scaron;katu </strong>analyzed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li data-ft="{'type':32}">
            <div>
              <div data-ft="{'type':33}">
                <div id="id_4eb98398d7ead2297948030"><strong>eq</strong> -   Human, Person; P1S2 'higher order animal life'<br />
                  <strong>a</strong> - OBL Case<br />
                  <strong>&scaron;k</strong> - COMPOSITE   configuration: -&gt; A mass/unit of people<br />
                  <strong>on</strong> - AGC<span class="style7">1</span>/7 suffix &quot;one enables   to&quot;<br />
                  <strong>&icirc;&scaron;k</strong> - DPR<span class="style7">1</span>/4 suffix &quot; not physically connected but with immediate   accessibility and ...knowledge of other member actions&quot; - so now we know what   kind of &quot;unit&quot; of people this is and that the word is the enablement of   such.<br />
                  <strong>at</strong> - MEC1/5 - ..by means of electronic binary switching<br />
                  <strong>u</strong> - AMG,   adding that it has a big social impact</div>
                <div></div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I really like his use of the DPR<span class="style7">1</span>/4 suffix here; I doubt I would've thought of that. Two small corrections to his analysis: The idea of enablement is given by the AGC<span class="style7">1</span> affix in Degree 2, not Degree 7, thus -<strong>&ouml;n</strong>, not -<strong>on</strong>. Also: the MEC<span class="style8">1</span>/5 suffix only indicates <em>&#8220;by electronic means&#8221;</em> -- if you want to specify binary switching, you'd have to drag in the incorporated root <strong>-&scaron;p-</strong> (P3S1 FML) as I did below in the full version for the word &quot;computer.&quot; (I don't think it's necessary.) And for easier pronunciation, I'd change the order of his suffixes. The end result being: <span class="style17">eqa&scaron;k&ouml;nat&icirc;&scaron;ku</span>.</p>
        <p>Anton's suggestion is <strong>&acirc;draxhtip&scaron;atek&scaron;arq&uacute;</strong>, which takes the word for &quot;computer&quot; and adds on the DRC<span class="style7">1</span>/3 and SPS<span class="style7">1</span>/5 suffixes plus <span class="style8">AMALGAMATIVE</span> context to give a word meaning <em>&#8220;an indirect 2nd-order level of computer-based infrastructure with strong social impact/ramifications.&#8221;</em> Interesting how Flo sees the Internet as a network of people through electronic means with big social impact, whereas Anton sees it as a network of computers with big social impact. What's even more interesting is that I, myself, was  thinking along a third line of reasoning, focused neither on people nor computers, but rather on information. But I think I'll stick to the above two words. </p>
        <p>Both are great efforts. I'd go with Flo's suggestion for contexts focusing on what the Internet is for and how each of us is part of it, whereas  Anton's word seems appropriate when focusing on how it works or is structured.</p>

The fact that I made a few last-minute changes to the morpho-phonology and the script after I'd already created several examples obviously hasn't helped either.</p>
        <p>Note: The brief epenthetic vowel following a glottal stop described in Section 1.2.2.1 does not count for purposes of antepenultimate or pre-antepenultimate syllabic stress. The rules for syllabic stress operate at the phonemic level, not the phonetic level.</p>

      <p>IMPORTANT: I am planning a big addition to the grammar of the language. There will be a whole new set of suffixes added to Chapter 7 that will greatly expand the  category of Format (see <a href="06_verbs_2.html#Sec6o4">Sec. 6.4</a>) for use with incorporated stems. These new suffixes will essentially be entirely new formats. Many, if not all of them, will correspond to noun cases,  so that a great many new kinds of relationships will be available between a primary stem and its incorporated stem. In many instances, these will allow for single-word substitutes for noun-to-noun case relationships. At this stage, I have only considered the idea conceptually; I have not yet mapped out the specific relationships nor assigned any morpho-phonological values to these suffixes. I anticipate I will be adding these to the website sometime in late 2011 or early 2012. The eventual update will include many new examples added to Section 6.4 on Format.</p>

      <td valign="top"><p>Florian's critique of my  Litany Against Fear translation has caused me to rethink the translation and make some changes. I have modified lines 2 and 3 to indicate ALLEGATIVE sanction. Also, I now realize the future tense used in Lines 6 and 8 in the English original implies intentionality rather than mere future time; it should therefore be translated by INTENTIVE modality (or the suffixed equivalent) rather than PROSPECTIVE aspect. And in Line 7, this use of English 'will' rises beyond intentionality to the level of a declarative statement, i.e., the speaker is willing the statement to be true, thus corresponding to DECLARATIVE illocution. Finally, while fear is spoken of as an abstract entity in Lines 2 and 3, it is personalized as the speaker's own feelings of fear in Lines 4 through 7 and should not, therefore, be expressed using ABSTRACT perspective or ABSTRACT personal reference, but MONADIC perspective and MONADIC inanimate personal reference. On the Texts page, I have now shown these modifications to the original translation in green. I have also added literal English reverse-translations of the Ithkuil version.</p>
        <p>Corrected the <strong>V<span class="style8">c</span>+C<span class="style8">z</span></strong> values of the last six cases in Table 28 in Chapter 8.</p>

      <td valign="top"><p>Well, as it turns out, I decided on the straightforward approach to the vocative -- I've made it  a new  noun case. You'll now find it described in new <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o8">Section 4.8</a>. While I was at it, I eliminated the DEFERENTIAL case and merged its function with the BENEFACTIVE case, so there are still a total of 96 cases. The <strong>Vc</strong> infix for the new VOCATIVE case is -<strong>&euml;</strong>-.  I have  updated <a href="04_case.html#Table7">Table 7</a> in Chapter 4 to reflect these changes, as well as the first line of the Lord's Prayer on the Texts page.</p>
        <p>As for the <strong>Vc</strong> and <strong>Vc+Cz</strong> forms used with personal reference adjuncts (see <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Sec8o1o2">Sec. 8.1.2</a>), I did some switching around. I changed the <strong>Vc</strong> and <strong>Vc+Cz</strong> values of the CONCESSIVE case to those of the now-obsolete DEFERENTIAL case, and have assigned the former values of the CONCESSIVE case to the new VOCATIVE case. The new values for the CONCESSIVE  and  VOCATIVE cases can be seen in <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Table28">Table 28</a> in Chapter 8.</p>
        <p>The tables of primary and secondary case/aspect written characters in Chapter 11 have also been updated to reflect these changes.</p>

      <td valign="top"><p>Florian from the Facebook group is attempting a translation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher's_fable" target="_blank">Schleicher's Fable</a>, which involves conveying indirect speech. Ithkuil handles indirect speech, as well as direct quotations in the same way, via case frame. In most cases this would be the OBLIQUE case-frame, considering the statement's semantic role as CONTENT of the verb 'speak/say', as in 'He said X,' where X is obviously not a semantic patient, enabler, experiencer, agent, stimulus, etc., but merely the non-causal content associated with the verb.</p>
        <p>Flo is also looking for a root for &quot;thing&quot; (looking at the fable I'm not sure why he needs such a stem, but it's his translation...). At any rate, I don't  have the stems from the root &quot;TANGIBLE OBJECT/THING/SUBSTANCE&quot; worked out yet, although  almost certainly  Informal Pattern 1, Stem 1 of the root will simply mean &quot;tangible object/thing; be/exist as a tangible object/thing.&quot; The root will most likely be -<strong>T&Ccedil;</strong>-. Or, in the meantime you could always use Pattern 1, Stem 1 of the root -<strong>C</strong>-, as a nominal formative (translation: <em>&quot;something that exists&quot;</em>).</p>
        <p>As for the vocative, I'm still toying with whether to make it a suffix, a case form, or a Slot IX <strong>Ci+Vi</strong> form (i.e., a new illocution like the DECLARATIVE, available only in FACTUAL mood). I'm leaning toward the latter solution.</p>

      <p>As for ordering of the days of the week, Ithkuil grammar arbitrarily chooses to follow the pattern of most Western European cultures in calling Sunday  the first day of the week, e.g., Portuguese <em>segunda-feira</em> 'Monday,' <em>ter&ccedil;a-feira</em> 'Tuesday' -- literally 'second-day,' 'third-day.' And in the 'on Sundays' example from Section 4.6.16, the Configuration could also be SEGMENTATIVE if you want to emphasize that the  recurring Sundays are subjectively  connected to each other (e.g., by the same activities or purpose or interdependency, such as when each Sunday's events/activities are dependent on the preceding Sunday's events/acitivities and likewise form the basis/foundation for the following Sunday's events/activities.)</p>
